# Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves tasks like text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), part-of-speech tagging, and semantic analysis. NLP is used in applications like chatbots, speech recognition, machine translation, and information retrieval, making it essential for bridging human-computer communication. Popular libraries for NLP include NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face's Transformers.
