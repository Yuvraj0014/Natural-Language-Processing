# Introduction to Natural-Language-Processing 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves tasks like text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), part-of-speech tagging, and semantic analysis. NLP is used in applications like chatbots, speech recognition, machine translation, and information retrieval, making it essential for bridging human-computer communication. Popular libraries for NLP include NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face's Transformers.

## 1 Tokenization:
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units, like words or subwords, for easier analysis in natural language processing. It helps convert raw text into structured data, enabling models to handle language more effectively. Tokenization is essential in tasks like language modeling, translation, and text classification.
## WordPunctTokenizer:
The WordPunctTokenizer splits text based on spaces and punctuation. It treats punctuation as separate tokens, which makes it useful for breaking down complex sentences.

For example:


Input: "Hello, world!"


Output: ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]
## TreebankWordTokenizer:
The TreebankWordTokenizer is designed based on the Penn Treebank standard. It handles punctuation and contractions better, splitting text into linguistically meaningful tokens. 


For example:


Input: "I can't do this."


Output: ["I", "ca", "n't", "do", "this", "."]
## Both are widely used in natural language processing tasks to preprocess text for further analysis.
